# InfoGraph

Repository for the computer graphics course project.  
The goal is to animate a car in a 3D environnement.

The project is made entirely with OpenGL, the render engine was made in class through practical work, the physics engine is my own making for the project.

## What's done :
Car controller  
Physics based car movement (Mostly inspired by the following thesis https://goo.gl/uhwnxg)  
Basic lighting  

## What's next :
Basic collisions  
Better lighting  
Texturing  

## Other features that I might implement depending on the time I have :
Rough terrain, bumps and corresponding car movement ?  
Procedural terrain with noise ?  
Skybox ?  

## Dependencies
SFML  
GLEW  
GLM
