# InfoGraph

Repository for the computer graphics course project.  
The goal is to animate a car in a 3D environnement.

The project is made entirely with OpenGL, the render engine was made in class through practical work, the physics engine is my own making for the project.

## Features :
Car controller  
Physics based car movement
Collision detection
Phong lighting

## Dependencies
SFML  
GLEW  
GLM  

Sources for the car movement algorithm and the collision detection can be found in the "Sources" folder
Reports for each practical works and for the project can be found in the "Rapports" folder
